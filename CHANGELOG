0.6.3
- add some name handling functions (merge #10 and #11)

0.6.2
- Fix building on 32 bit platforms.

0.6.1
- Add a method to check when a context is fully initialized

0.6.0
- Add support for channel bindings

0.5.1
- Fix minor error codes were not handled correctly by the error
  display logic. Now problems should be easer to debug since minor
  codes often contain the actual reason for an error.

0.5.0
- Remove locking and arc wrappers from context. There is no good
  reason to have them, and they remove the user's choice of
  locking. Now contexts can't be cloned, and all api calls require a
  mutable reference, which enforces the same invariants as before. If
  you want the old behavior, simply wrap the client and/or server
  context in an Arc<Mutex<t>>. Sorry for any churn this may cause.

0.4.6 and 0.2.4
- fix build with no LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- upgrade to the latest bindgen

0.4.5 and 0.2.3
- fix build on nixos
- use krb5-config to find libgssapi when available

libgssapi 0.4.2 and libgssapi-sys 0.2.2:
- improve safety, remove all transmutes
- port to macos using native GSS framework
- seperate gss_iov_* functions into a feature (on by default), as they
  are not supported on macos
- address #2
